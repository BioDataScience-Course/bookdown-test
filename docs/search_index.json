Figures and tables are in their own environments: par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2016) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). In the example minimum repo there is an example of deployment using Travis-CI. If some computation is time consuming, we could consider to cache it: # A verrry long computation! 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 To number equations and allow to refer to them, use an equation environment and label them with the syntax (\\#eq:label): \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] … and here, I refer to eq. (1.1). In the vase equations are not labelled, use the equation* environment instead. To makes parts in the book, use # (PART) Part I {-} just before the first title of that part. Also, you can use # 5APPENDIX) Appendix {-} just before appendices titles. Text reference is especially useful for long captions, or captions with special formattings. plot(cars) # a scatterplot Figure 1.2: This is my caption with formatting… TODO: browse the bookdown book from 2.4 Figures on….
